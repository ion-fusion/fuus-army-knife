FuusArmyKnife
=============

FuusArmyKnife is a Fusion multi-tool written in Rust. Today, it provides:

- Auto-formatting
- Enforcement of code style (similar to Java Checkstyle)
- `check-correctness-watch` sub-command that watches your changes as you write Fusion code and reports on errors that it detects

Why is it called "Fuus", and how do I pronounce it?
---------------------------------------------------

The name was intended to sound somewhat similar to "Swiss Army Knife", but for Fusion. "Fuus" is
pronounced like "food" with a "S" instead of a "D". You can also call it `fuusak` since that's what
the compiled CLI binary's name is.
